[B]AIO Debrid updated to v3.0[/B]

-**NEW** DiggzFlix build using Bingie Skin.
-Removed seperate Flix builds as new DiggzFlix skin is much better.
-Removed Flavors in Xenon builds. Too much work to maintain, not enough time. TMDBH is default.
-Replaced Setup Wizard with new setup wizard to help on laggy devices. 
-Lots of live tv updates
